Couldn't find the bug page. I'm eithor stupid or blind.

Bug. All spaces in the Arcane Compendium have been remvoed. I.g. : This is right. Turned into :ThisIsWrong
No spaces on any of the pages.

The link from the mod page led me here. Feel free to move it and send me a message at SargonRose@gmail.com

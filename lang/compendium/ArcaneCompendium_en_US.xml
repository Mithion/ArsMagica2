			<name>Beam</name>
			<desc>It isn't much of a mental shift to switch from a channeled spell to a beam.  The amount of strain, however, is another story.  A beam is a much more controlled version of a channeled spell.</desc>

			<name>Self</name>
			<desc>One of the simplest forms of magic application is applying the magic to yourself.  The distance is low, and the target is willing.  You only hope you don't accidentally light yourself on fire.</desc>

		<component id="PhysicalDamage">
			<name>Physical Damage</name>
			<desc>Often a young mage will begin his training with simple physical force.  More often he will continue that training by smacking his colleagues in the back of the head with more physical force.  Physical damage is one of the weaker damage types, and does not pierce armor.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="MagicDamage">
			<name>Magic Damage</name>
			<desc>Magical damage differs from physical damage in that it bypasses many kinds of armors and attacks the target's aura directly - which can be just as devastating, if not more.  This makes summoned and charmed creatures especially vulnerable, making them take triple damage.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="FrostDamage">
			<name>Frost Damage</name>
			<desc>Many underestimate the power that frost can wield.  The creeping chill can bypass many armors, and frost is devstating against the denizens of the nether.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="LightningDamage">
			<name>Lightning Damage</name>
			<desc>I held my hands in front of me, and with a sharp crack a bolt of brilliant white lightning forked across the sky.  His metal armor acted as a lightning rod, drawing each bolt down into him.  Lightning does an exceptional amount of damage, but carries a hefty mana cost.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="FireDamage">
			<name>Fire Damage</name>
			<desc>With a word, I released my will and fire erupted from out in front of me, searing everything in its path.  Fire damage is hard hitting, but many nether mobs are immune to its effects.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="Ignition">
			<name>Ignition</name>
			<desc>Many magi see fire as a damaging, destructive force, and that can be true.  But how many hear fire and imagine lighting a stove, campfire or candle?  </desc>
		</component>
		<component id="Forge">
			<name>Forge</name>

		<component id="Freeze">
			<name>Freeze</name>
			<desc>Eira breathed deeply and opened her eyes.  The caps of the mountains now glistened white with snow and a sublime frost covered everything.  Water had become ice.  Enemies moved at a crawl.  Perfect.</desc>

		<component id="Storm">
			<name>Thunderstorm</name>
			<desc>The clouds darkened, and rain began to fall.  The wind howled, and a flash of lightning streaked across the sky, leaving bright flashes in my vision.  The thunder was deafening.  Lightning struck all around me at each enemy.  The strain of maintaining the storm was immense. </desc>
		</component>
		<component id="AstralDistortion">
			<name>Astral Distortion</name>
			<desc>As I tried to step into the void, the warp shimmered and seemed to solidify.  I walked face first into it, much to the amusement of my students.  This effect seemed to prevent my teleportation abilities entirely.  I had to turn this against Endermen as well.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="Fling">
			<name>Fling</name>
			<desc>Wind whirled around under the creeper and suddenly all at once blew straight up, sending it skyward.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="WateryGrave">
			<name>Watery Grave</name>
			<desc>The water seemed to come alive, wrapping tendrils around the light mage and dragging him down into the black, crushing depths.  His friend on the shore could only watch helplessly, for to jump into the water would mean the same fate for him.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="Leap">
			<name>Leap</name>
			<desc>Gathering wind around me, I propelled myself into the air.  I held the wind close through the jump, releasing it in an upward burst just as I landed, protecting me from the fall.</desc>

Kill enough of the same mob and you will fill the phylactery. !d During spell creation, you can throw in any filled phylactery when prompted by the lectern.  This step is what determines what your spell will summon. !d Summoned creatures drop no loot, and no xp, but can be interacted with normally, such as breeding, milking cows, or riding horses.  Horses are the exception to the item drop rule and will drop saddles and armor given to them. !l Tameable creatures such as wolves and cats are automatically tamed to their owner upon summoning. </desc>

			<desc>A more advanced version of simple robes, mage armor allows for slightly more durability, recharge, and protection.  Mage armor, due to the runes inlaid in it, has very high capability to be enchanted.  It also can repair its condition using mana drawn from its wearer.  When wearing a full suit of mage armor, your mana regen speed is increased and all spells are slightly more effective.</desc>

It has higher durability than Mage Armor, but has a slower repair rate and less enchantability, as well as giving lesser versions of the magical bonuses that mage armor does.  Battlemage Armor can also be given XP which will unlock protective spells that will come to the aid of its wearer, draining some of the magic within the armor.  The magic will then infuse back over time from your own mana pool.</desc>

This puts the source block in a #5pairing mode#0, indicated by a white beam shooting skyward. Then, #9click on the destination#0.  This will force a pairing, and ensures the essence goes where you want it to.  Keep in mind that if you force a different type of power through, it will destroy any power contained in the destination.  !p The crystal wrench can also be used to show hidden particle emitters, and can copy their settings by right clicking.  The settings can then be pasted to another emitter by right clicking.  Each time you "paste" settings, you will need to copy them again if you wish to paste to additional emitters.</desc>

			<name>Essence Nexus</name>
			<controller>TileEntityEssenceNexus</controller>
			<desc>Adapted as a middle ground between the Light Nexus and the Dark Nexus, the Essence Nexus boasts more powerful generation capabilities than the Light Nexus, but without the side effects of the Dark Nexus.  It requires at least one liquid essence source or flowing block below it to act as a source of power.  Keep in mind the essence cannot be directly below it as breaking the block directly below will also destroy the nexus.  Once one block is found below it (up to 10 blocks down), the nexus will search recursively based off of that location in an attempt to find additional liquid essence sources.  It will continually drain the liquid essence source blocks found and create raw essence.  The liquid essence source blocks are eventually consumed.  Each one gives roughly 500 essence, but there is some randomization to it.  Flowing liquid essence blocks are not used to generate power and are not consumed, but are used to search for additional source blocks.</desc>

		<structure id="darkNexus">			
			<name>Dark Nexus</name>
			<controller>TileEntityDarkNexus</controller>
			<desc>A sinister construction, the Dark Nexus slowly but invariably pulls living creatures from around it inward to its center.  Upon reaching the middle, the souls of the damned emerge from the nexus and tear the life force out of the creature.  The Dark Nexus feeds on the life force, gaining a great deal of power; the more life experiences the creature has had, and the strength of its constitution all play a role in power generation.  The power does come with a cost though, as the Dark Nexus will rapidly corrupt the area its in, so great is its evil.  It produces a dark power that tends to make machines run faster, but become unstable over periods of extended use.</desc>

		<structure id="lightNexus">			
			<name>Light Nexus</name>
			<controller>TileEntityLightNexus</controller>
			<desc>The Light Nexus is by far the weakest of the three, but is the most easily attainable, as well as the most reliable.  Drawing essence out of the atmosphere, the Light Nexus will serve to increase the purity of an area.  It requires no items or living souls as sacrifice, and constantly generates power, but at a steady trickle.  It does have the benefit of being able to upgrade its capstones with gold, and eventually diamond, to be more powerful.  The power it provides causes machines to run slower, but often provides additional benefits to their operation.</desc>

		<structure id="gateways">
			<name>Gateway</name>
			<controller>TileEntityKeystoneRecepticle</controller>
			<desc>Gateways are quite efficient at short range, but longer distances require significantly more power.  The maximum range for a Gateway has been tested to be roughly 12km, though an extreme amount of power is required to traverse such a span.  A keystone can be inserted into the Keystone Receptacle in order to lock the gateway to the keystone's rune combination.  Only then by activating another gateway with a matching keystone can one arrive at the keyed gateway.  If the key does not match or no keystone is held at all when the gate is activated, it will be as if the keyed gateway doesn't even exist.  This method can be used to control where you will wind up in the gateway network.</desc>

		<structure id="craftingAltar">
			<name>Crafting Altar</name>
			<controller>TileEntityCraftingAltar</controller>			
			<desc>
			Harnessing the forces of creation, the crafting altar allows mages to work miracles of magic.  This is where you will create all of your spells in Ars Magica.  The structure is upgradeable by 2 main groups, the caps and the main material.  Both groups individually increase the available power of the altar and allow it to make more powerful spells.  The main blocks, in order of power, are as follows:
			!l
			Wood Planks (+1 Effect)
			!l
			Stone Brick (+1 Effect)
			!l
			Sandstone (+1 Effect)
			!l
			Bricks (+2 Effects)
			!l
			Witchwood (+3 Effects)
			!l
			Nether Bricks (+3 Effects)
			!l
			Nether Quartz (+3 Effects)
			!l
			!l
			For the caps (grand total of 5 in the structure), the progression is as follows:
			!l
			Glass (+1 Effect)
			!l
			Coal Blocks (+2 Effects)
			!l
			Redstone Blocks (+3 Effects)
			!l
			Iron Blocks (+4 Effects)
			!l
			Lapis Blocks (+5 Effects)
			!l
			Gold Blocks (+6 Effects)
			!l
			Diamond Blocks (+7 Effects)
			!l
			Emerald Blocks (+8 Effects)
			!l
			Moonstone Blocks (+9 Effects)
			!l
			Sunstone Blocks (+10 Effects)
			!l
			!l
			These stack cumulatively, so for example wood planks with glass caps would equal a maximum of 2 effects, whereas stone bricks with redstone caps would have a maximum of 4 effects in a spell.  The maximum number of effects you can currently have on a spell is 13.

On top of the obsidian, build an iron inlay ring.  Off of each side, place a vinteum torch.  Then throw in a blue topaz, an emerald, and a chimerite. !d Upon summoning, the Earth Guardian will cleave out a large area of the surrounding blocks, so it would be wise to summon somewhere other than your basement.</desc>

			<name>Illusion Blocks</name>
			<desc>
			Illusion blocks are so realistic that your brain will not allow you to walk through them due to self preservation and common sense.  Only with true sight can you convince yourself that the illusion is not real, and pass through to the other side.

			<desc>"Essence is in everything.  But to extract it in its purest form; that will require some special machinery." -Antimony Dalen, scholar at the White Mage Citadel</desc>

		<block id="essenceconduit">
			<name>Essence Conduit</name>
			<desc>Infused with dusts to direct essence through the air, the Essence Conduit began seeing heavy use almost immediately after its invention.  However, channeling such magic often creates a minor void inside the crystal, a defecit of magic.  Should this not be properly managed, the residual essence in the air will violently shatter the vinteum crystal in order to balance the scales once again.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="crystalpillar">
			<name>Crystal Pillar</name>
			<desc>Originally intended to be an improved design of the Essence Conduit, researchers found its ability to channel essence severely lacking.  The materials simply didn't have the conductiveness to relay enough power.  However, the materials were exceptional at preventing magical voids from forming.  A slight re-design allowed these crystals to directly inject residual mana from the area into a magical void from a short distance away, stabilizing it and preventing the vinteum crystals in an Essence Conduit from rupturing.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="blockcaster">
			<name>Caster</name>
			<desc>A spell is nothing more than directed essence.  The will of a magic user dictates what the essence does, and if they have enough capacity for essence, the magic will flow forth.  The caster was designed to replicate that ability, converting raw essence into a burst of magic that is directed through a spell focus (as well as the occasional mana focus) and shaped via the instructions on a spell scroll.  Because of the extreme essence draw of certain spells, the internal crystals were fitted with a slot to allow a charge focus which causes the amount of incoming essence to be increased substantially.  Alternately, a mana focus can be fitted into the same slots, causing the internal essence routing to be much more efficient.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="blockseerstone">
			<name>Seer Stone</name>
			<desc>Operating on a similar principle as the Astral Barrier, the Seer Stone uses an essence aura projected through a spell focus to detect nearby objects.  It can be controlled by focusing the essence to a particular type of object, and the resonant frequency of the essence can be dictated with the use of a Keystone.  Without the use of a Keystone, the resonant frequency fluxuates unpredictably and cannot be avoided.  The seer stone, however, is meant for a more subtle approach, letting the object continue, but emitting a small signal that often activates much more powerful defenses.  By sneaking up and activating the stone, one can even (if he has the correct key of course) cause the stone to invert its detection methods, detecting those with the matching keystone combination.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="blockastralbarrier">
			<name>Astral Barrier</name>
			<desc>When walking the void, one must be aware of barriers.  Projecting an essence aura through a spell focus, these barriers resonate at a specific magical frequency, dictated by a keytstone.  Without the proper matching keystone, these barriers will destabilize your magics and force you out of the void.  Should the astral barrier not have a keystone present, its magic frequency will fluxuate unpredictably, and no amount of Keystones can protect you from its effects.  Several Dark Magi raids have been foiled and several Light Magi have been captured due to their failure to spot the barrier in time.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="blockkeystonerecepticle">
			<name>Keystone Recepticle</name>
			<desc>Not all magi are capable of walking the void as a means of travel, nor are all willing.  The void is detectable, blockable.  Gateways were developed by the Dark Magi early in the war, and it allowed them to take many Light Mage encampments by surprise, as it uses alternate pathways to transport to its destination.  Astral Barriers were ineffective at stopping the arrival of the Dark Magi, and the destination gate required no power of its own.  The Light Magi destroyed as many as they could find, but the Dark Magi only needed one.  The only hope was when a young Light Mage by the name of Damien Callitri discovered that the gateways could be locked down if a Keystone was inserted into a flaw in the design at just the right spot in the gateway mechanism, and would actually cause the gateway to send the Dark Mages to a different gateway (or nowhere if none others existed that weren't locked down).  This halted the raids completely, and allowed the White Magi to turn the tides back in their favour, as they could actually use the gateways to return to their keystone gate.  The design flaw became jokingly known as the "Keystone Recepticle" amongst the White Magi.</desc>

		<block id="ore_vinteum">
			<name>Vinteum Ore</name>
			<desc>Vinteum was discovered during a heated battle between the Light and Dark magi when a stray arcane bolt collided with an ender bolt.  The resulting explosion created a crater several meters deep, where a sparkling blue ore shimmered in the light of the afternoon.  It appears to have no magical properties of its own, but when heat is applied, it becomes a fine dust with an exceptional capacity to conduct essence.  As such, it is widely used in magical contraptions all over the world.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="mana_battery">
			<name>Mana Battery</name>
			<desc>Drawing further on vinteum dust's ability to conduct essence, a small group of brilliant magi created a frame out of iron and gold which is capable of storing massive amounts of essence.  The ratios of iron to gold cause any power entering the battery to be polarized, removing it of any dark or light power effects.  Mana batteries will always provide power to connected devices, but they can also request power from a nexus (or another battery) when given a redstone signal.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="blue_orchid">
			<name>Blue Orchid</name>
			<desc>Blue Orchids thrive in lush, green environments.  They were one of the first magical plants discovered, being used in potions and salves.  The Blue Orchid emits a faint sparkling glow of light around it as well, and was used just as much for decoration as an alchemical ingredient.  A short while after its discovery, it was also noted that the Blue Orchid could be used as part of the purification process for Vinteum dust.  It is said that anywhere a Blue Orchid can grow, Wisps aren't usually far off.</desc>

		<block id="desert_nova">
			<name>Desert Nova</name>
			<desc>Desert Novas grow in dry conditions.  They get their name from the small bursts of magic that they periodically emit.  The Nova has extraordinary magical properties for a desert plant, and is highly sought after.  It is one of the two plants used in the purification process of Vinteum dust.</desc>

		<block id="keystonechest">
			<name>Keystone Chest</name>
			<desc>The keystone chest was developed as a simple way to have a magically locked chest.  When a keystone is inserted into the internal slot, in order to open it, one must have a matching keystone in their hand.  By inserting the keystone into the outer lock*, the chest can be opened.  If there is no keystone, the chest opens normally.

		<block id="magicWall">
			<name>Magic Wall</name>
			<desc>An early attempt at the illusion block, the magic wall wasn't really able to blend with it's surroundings.  Or even prevent people from looking through.  The value, though, was just after having master mage Leonidus criticize us for our efforts, watching him walk face first into one.  That's when we knew it at least had the stopping power part right.  But when the fireball he threw at it BOUNCED back and burnt his beard off, we knew it was a keeper.</desc>

		<block id="lectern">
			<name>Lectern</name>
			<desc>A must have for any organized mage, the Lectern is an ideal place to store books, compendiums, and thaumonomicons for easy access.  The book sits perfectly where it can be read without having to remove it from the lectern.  It is also a critical part of the Crafting Altar, as spell crafting does require organization.</desc>

There are 3 kinds of skill points, which can be learned by obtaining Infinity Orbs from Dungeons, other worldgen, and Summoning Rituals.  The skills, when learnable, will glow with the corresponding skill point needed to unlock it.  Blue are the most common skill points, followed by Green, and finally Red.</desc>

		<block id="inscriptionTable">
			<name>Inscription Table</name>
			<desc>Organization is a must for any mage who wants to be successful.  Using this table along with a writable book, you can compose spells of incredible power.  Most mages will lay out what spell parts they know at the top of the table, and will drag them to the bottom area of the table to lay out a spell.  Once satisfied with the spell, you can write the spells down in a writable book (you did remember to bring one, didn't you?).  This book can be placed upon a lectern that is part of the Crafting Altar structure, and will guide you through the process needed to make the spell.  The book is worth reading too, as it contains a recap of the spell you will be creating, a materials list, and an affinity breakdown.</desc>

		<block id="particleEmitter">
			<name>Particle Emitter</name>
			<desc>Purely a decoration block, the particle emitter can be used to create a magical feel in any area.  The emitter can be customized by right clicking it, and it can be hidden.  If hidden, simply holding a crystal wrench while near it will cause it to be visible again.  Right clicking a particle emitter with a crystal wrench will cause its settings to be copied.  Right clicking another particle emitter will copy those settings to the second emitter.</desc>

			<name>Summoner</name>
			<desc>The summoner takes essence one step farther and uses it to summon creatures to do your bidding upon receipt of a redstone signal.  It has a hefty summon cost, as well as a maintain cost to keep the summon alive.  If the redstone signal ever dies out or power runs out, the creature will unsummon.  When the creature is unsummoned or killed, there is a short delay before it can be summoned again.  Note that the summoner requires a full-fledged summon spell, not a filled crystal phylactery.</desc>

		<block id="inlays">
			<name>Inlays</name>
			<desc>Inlays are runes that are used both for decoration and for summoning bosses when placed into the right pattern (see Structures).  There are a few different types of Inlay.</desc>
			<subitem id="redstone_inlay">
				<name>Redstone Inlay</name>
				<desc>Redstone inlays are the most basic of inlay.  They are used to summon bosses, and can also be used as rails.  They will speed up a minecart as it passes over them.  Be wary when cornering too fast, as the cart can leave the tracks entirely.</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="iron_inlay">
				<name>Iron Inlay</name>
				<desc>Iron inlays are an intermediate inlay.  They are used to summon bosses, and can also be used as rails.  When a minecart touches an iron inlay, it will reverse direction.  Some of the momentum is preserved, but not all.</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="gold_inlay">
				<name>Gold Inlay</name>
				<desc>Gold inlays are the most advanced inlay.  They are used to summon the most powerful of bosses.  They can also be used as rails.  When a minecart touches a gold inlay, it will attempt to warp to the next gold inlay in the direction it is currently traveling within 8 blocks.  This can transport the minecart (and any passengers) through solid obstacles, as it is in fact teleportation.  There is a short delay before the minecart can teleport on a gold rail again after it warps.</desc>

		<mechanic id="affinity">
			<name>Affinities</name>
			<desc>#5Affinity#0 represents a bond to certain areas of magic.  You start with no affinity.  Your affinity is represented as a small chart on the HUD, and can be viewed in more detail at an Occulus (craftable Block).  Your affinity will shift based on what spells you cast, meaning as you cast certain types of spells more often, you will get better at them.
			Casting spells of a differing affinity will shift you towards that affinity.  Once you reach 100% in an affinity, you become locked to that affinity, and will need to read an opposing affinity tome to unlock your affinity, at which point normal progression will resume.  Unlocking a full affinity will drop you down to 80% depth.
			
			Each spell component has an affinity.  Components of the same affinity as you will cost less mana, and depending on your affinity depth (how far into the affinity you are), may not even cost reagents.  Components of the opposing affinity, however, will cost more mana and again, depending on your affinity depth, may cost additional reagents.  Affinities offer specific bonuses and disadvantages, described on the affinity-specific pages.			
			</desc>
			<subitem id="earth_affinity">
				<name>Earth Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Earth affinity grants a minor defense bonus, due to your hardened skin.  At max, you will have 10% overall damage reduction, applied before armor.  This amount depends on your affinity depth into earth, and begins at 25% depth.
					!d
					With earth affinity, you are heavier, and as such you will sink more quickly in water (though never enough that you cannot surface), and you cannot fall as far without taking fall damage.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="water_affinity">
				<name>Water Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Water affinity grants a bonus to swim speed as well as slower breath loss underwater.  You are also not pushed by flowing water.  Endermen that attack a full water-affinity mage will take damage as if they had touched water.
					!d
					Water affinity mages take damage periodically if exposed to fire, making the nether particularly dangerous.  This damage will not take you below 75% health, and will not occur at all if you are lower.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="air_affinity">
				<name>Air Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Air affinity grants a bonus to jump height and lets you fall farther before taking damage.  These bonuses are dependent on your affinity depth: you can jump one block higher and fall one block farther at 50% depth.  This bonus increases to 2 at 75%, and 3 at full depth.
					!d
					Air affinity mages are hindered by rain and storms; the wind blows you around and you must move slower.  #5Sneaking#0 or casting a spell of #5Gravity Well#0 can negate the effect and allow you to move in the storm, albeit slowly.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="fire_affinity">
				<name>Fire Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Fire affinity grants damage reduction in fire and lava, though never complete immunity.  The protection is directly related to your affinity depth, and reaches 60% reduction at full depth.  Punching enemies at full affinity will light them on fire.
					!d
					Once your fire affinity reaches 50%, you will start to take damage periodically when touching water sources.  This damage will not take you down below 75% health and will not occur if lower.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="nature_affinity">
				<name>Nature Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Nature affinity gives you additional seeds and saplings when harvesting plants from around the world.  At 50% depth, you will gain the Thorns effect, causing melee attackers to take damage (similar to the armor enchant).  This damage increases at 75% affinity and at full affinity.  At full nature affinity you also slowly regenerate hunger in direct sunlight.  At full nature affinity, you can extend roots into the ground, allowing you to climb certain surfaces like a spider does.
					!d
					Nature affinity causes you to move slightly slower due to your roots. At full nature affinity depth, you lose hunger more quickly at night or in dark areas.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="ice_affinity">
				<name>Ice Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Ice affinity causes attackers to be slowed.  At 50% depth, while sneaking you will freeze water to ice in front of you, allowing you to make bridges as you move.  At 100% depth, you can freeze lava to obsidian.
					!d
					All ice mages move slightly slower due to being cold blooded, unless on ice or water.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="lightning_affinity">
				<name>Lightning Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Lightning affinity causes you to run faster.  The speed increase is directly related to your affinity depth, ranging from 1 to 30%.  At 50% depth, you gain the ability to step up over one block high ledges.
					!d
					Unfortunately due to your affinity you are also somewhat of a living lightning rod (50% depth or greater).  Better take cover during rain and thunderstorms.  Lightning bolts still hurt.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="life_affinity">
				<name>Life Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Life affinity causes you to very slowly regenerate additional life.  The regen speed is directly related to your depth.  This regen happens regardless of your hunger level.
					!d
					Due to your close ties with life, any time you kill something it makes you sick and nauseated for a while.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="arcane_affinity">
				<name>Arcane Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Arcane affinity causes all spells to cost 5% less mana, in addition to other mana reductions.  At full depth, there is also a chance that upon casting a spell, you will gain the clarity effect, causing your next spell to cost 0 mana.
					!d
					As a disadvantage, all magical damage sources do more damage to you.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="ender_affinity">
				<name>Ender Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Ender affinity gives you poison resistance at 50% depth, and at 75% depth you gain night vision automatically in dark areas.  At full ender affinity, Endermen will not attack you, unless you attack them first.
					!d
					Due to your dark nature, your maximum health is reduced in light, and at full ender affinity, it is reduced in water as well.

			<name>Foreword</name>
			<desc>Ars Magica began as my first foray into modding.  I have been developing software professionally for about 11 years as of AM2's release, but haven't done much game design.  I loved the game of Minecraft, but felt that it would be the perfect place for a magical world.  So I began, and who would have thought I would enjoy it so much.  I have spent literally hundreds of hours developing AM1 and AM2.  With some good tutorials and a bit of luck, I managed to figure out how to write AM1.  Now I have taken what I learned, solved some of the problems that came up (and probably introduced twice as many more), and have made Ars Magica 2.  I want to thank all of the people who helped this mod come to be what it is today, my beta testers, everyone who helped me with code, models, and texturing - this wouldn't be what it is without you.  And to you, the player, I hope that you have as much fun playing this mod as I did making it. !d Happy Casting! !l ~Mithion</desc>

			<name>Spell Components 101</name>
			<desc>Spells are comprised of #4shapes#0, #9components#0, and #2modifiers#0.  Shapes dictate how the spell targets things, Components dictate what the spell does to the things it targets, and Modifiers change certain aspects of spells.  A #4shape#0 can only appear once in a single spell.  Shapes can be chained together to create spell stages, for example, a "Projectile AoE".  Components can be added once per spell stage. As for modifiers, a single aspect of a spell can be modified three times per stage.  What this means is that if you have modifiers that change multiple parts of a spell, they may lock out other ones that modify the same stats if the total stat modifier for the shape is equal to three.  The compendium will only show you the shapes, components, and modifiers you already know, or are eligible to learn.</desc>

AM2 also has specific integration with better dungeons, so if you install that mod, there will be specific AM dungeons to find and explore as well.</desc>

			<name>The Essence System</name>
			<desc>Ars Magica contains a unique power system called #5Essence#0.  Essence is generated from a #5Nexus#0.  A Nexus will stream to other powered blocks within a 10 block radius.  To extend the range of the nexus, you can place #5essence conduits#0 within the 10 blocks of the nexus.  Each conduit also projects a radius of 10 blocks in which it can relay power from the nexus, essentially extending the range in a chain. !d #5Conduits#0 and #5Other Machines powered by essence such as Calefactors, Reconstructors, etc#0 can only transmit/consume so much power in a given period of time before they begin to build up #4deficit#0.  Machines will begin to smoke as deficit increases, and conduits also turn red.  As deficit grows, the machines will become less efficient, and will require more power to perform their standard operations.  Once deficit reaches a certain point (1000), the machine will shut down and will be unable to operate until the deficit drops below 1000 again.  Deficit can be mitigated by inserting #5charge foci#0 or #5mana foci$0 into the conduit, or by placing a #5crystal pillar#0 next to the conduit if that isn't enough.  See conduits for more information.</desc>

			<name>Types of Nexi</name>
			<desc>There are three types of nexus, and three types of essence.  Light, Neutral, and Dark.  See structures for crafting and variations of each of these.  Each type of power affects machines in a different way, and has advantages and disadvantages.  You will also need all three types of power available for spell crafting, as certain shapes, components, and modifiers can require different types of essence.</desc>

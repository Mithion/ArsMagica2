			<name>Channeled</name>

		</shape>
		<shape id="Beam">
			<name>Beam</name>
			<desc>It isn't much of a mental shift to switch from a channeled spell to a beam.  The amount of strain, however, is another story.  A beam is a much more controlled version of a channeled spell.</desc>
		</shape>
		<shape id="Self">
			<name>Self</name>
			<desc>One of the simplest forms of magic application is applying the magic to yourself.  The distance is low, and the target is willing.  You only hope you don't accidentally light yourself on fire.</desc>
		</shape>
		<shape id="Summon">
			<name>Summon</name>

		</shape>
		<shape id="Contingency_Fall">
			<name>Contingency: Fall</name>
			<desc>You have figured out a spell shape that triggers when falling the instant before you hit the ground. !line! !line! Oh gravity, thou art a heartless... !line! !line! You can only have one contingency active at a time.</desc>
		</shape>
		<shape id="Contingency_Damage">
			<name>Contingency: Damage</name>
			<desc>You have managed to create a spell that triggers only when you get hurt. !line! !line! Let's play shot for shot. !line! !line! You can only have one contingency active at a time.</desc>

		</shape>
		<shape id="Binding">
			<name>Binding</name>
			<desc>You can create solid objects out of nothing!  The binding shape allows you to bind tools to yourself, which drain constant mana while bound, and burst mana when used instead of durability.  Dropping the item with the drop hotkey (default 'q') will instead unbind it. !line! !line! This shape is not implemented yet.</desc>

		</component>
		<component id="MagicDamage">
			<name>Magic Damage</name>
			<desc>Magical damage differs from physical damage in that it bypasses many kinds of armors and attacks the target's aura directly - which can be just as devastating, if not more.  This makes summoned creatures especially vulnerable.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="FrostDamage">
			<name>Frost Damage</name>
			<desc>Many underestimate the power that frost can wield.  The creeping chill can bypass many armors, and frost is devstating against the denizens of the nether.</desc>

		<component id="LightningDamage">
			<name>Lightning Damage</name>
			<desc>I held my hands in front of me, and with a sharp crack a bolt of brilliant white lightning forked across the sky.  His metal armor acted as a lightning rod, drawing each bolt down into him.</desc>

		<component id="Freeze">
			<name>Freeze</name>
			<desc>Eira breathed deeply and opened her eyes.  The caps of the mountains now glistened white with snow and a sublime frost covered everything.  Water had become ice.  Nothing was moving.  Perfect.</desc>

		<component id="Storm">
			<name>Thunderstorm</name>
			<desc>The clouds darkened, and rain began to fall.  The wind howled, and a flash of lightning streaked across the sky, leaving bright flashes in my vision.  The thunder was deafening.  Lightning struck all around me at each enemy.  The strain of maintaining the storm was immense. </desc>
		</component>
		<component id="AstralDistortion">
			<name>Astral Distortion</name>
			<desc>As I tried to step into the void, the warp shimmered and seemed to solidify.  I walked face first into it, much to the amusement of my students.  I had to turn this against Endermen as well.</desc>

			<name>Watery Grave</name>
			<desc>The water seemed to come alive, wrapping tendrils around the light mage and dragging him down into the black, crushing depths.</desc>
		</component>
		<component id="Leap">
			<name>Leap</name>
			<desc>Gathering wind around me, I propelled myself into the air.  I held the wind close through the jump, releasing it in an upward burst just as I landed, protecting me from the fall.</desc>

			<name>Battlemage Armor</name>
			<desc>Granted only to mages who have proven themselves true masters, Battlemage Armor offers a good amount of protection.  It has higher durability than Mage Armor, but has a slower repair rate and less enchantability, as well as giving lesser versions of the magical bonuses that mage armor does.  Battlemage Armor can also be given XP which will unlock protective spells that will come to the aid of its wearer, draining some of the magic within the armor.  The magic will then infuse back over time from your own mana pool.</desc>

To do this, right click first on the source of power you want to use, then click on the destination.  This will force a pairing, and ensures the essence goes where you want it to.  Keep in mind that if you force a different type of power through, it will destroy any power contained in the destination.  !page! The crystal wrench can also be used to show hidden particle emitters, and can copy their settings by right clicking.  The settings can then be pasted to another emitter by right clicking.  Each time you "paste" settings, you will need to copy them again if you wish to paste to additional emitters.</desc>

			<desc>Adapted as a middle ground between the Light Nexus and the Dark Nexus, the Essence Nexus boasts more powerful generation capabilities than the Light Nexus, but without the side effects of the Dark Nexus.  It requires at least one liquid essence source block directly below it to act as a source of power.  It will continually drain the liquid essence and create raw essence.</desc>

			<controller>TileEntityDarkNexus</controller>
			<desc>A sinister construction, the Dark Nexus slowly but invariably pulls living creatures from around it inward to its center.  Upon reaching the middle, the souls of the damned emerge from the nexus and tear the life force out of the creature.  The Dark Nexus feeds on the life force, gaining a great deal of power; the more life experiences the creature has had, and the strength of its constitution all play a role in power generation.  The power does come with a cost though, as the Dark Nexus will rapidly corrupt the area its in, so great is its evil.  It produces a dark power that tends to make machines run faster, but become unstable over periods of extended use.</desc>

			<desc>The Light Nexus is by far the weakest of the three, but is the most easily attainable, as well as the most reliable.  Drawing essence out of the atmosphere, the Light Nexus will serve to increase the purity of an area.  It requires no items or living souls as sacrifice, and constantly generates power, but at a steady trickle.  It does have the benefit of being able to upgrade its capstones with gold, and eventually diamond, to be more powerful.  The power it provides causes machines to run slower, but often provides additional benefits to their operation.</desc>

			<desc>Gateways were originally created by the Dark Magi as a means of stealth attack on the Light Magi.  Creating several of these gateways using what is now known as a Keystone Recepticle, they were able to cover a lot of ground with a relatively small force, while the majority of the Dark Magi were free to concentrate on other mantters.  The gateways are extremely efficient at short range, but longer distances require significantly more power.  The maximum range for a Gateway has been tested to be roughly 12km, though an extreme amount of power is required to traverse such a span.</desc>

			Harnessing the forces of creation, the crafting altar allows mages to work miracles of magic.  This is where you will create all of your spells in Ars Magica.  The structure is upgradeable by 2 main groups, the caps and the main material.  Both groups individually increase the available power of the altar and allow it to make more powerful spells.  The main blocks, in order of power, are as follows:
			!line!
			Wood Planks (+1 Effect)
			!line!
			Stone Brick (+1 Effect)
			!line!
			Sandstone (+1 Effect)
			!line!
			Bricks (+2 Effects)
			!line!
			Nether Bricks (+3 Effects)
			!line!
			Nether Quartz (+3 Effects)
			!line!
			!line!
			For the caps (grand total of 5 in the structure), the progression is as follows:
			!line!
			Glass (+1 Effect)
			!line!
			Coal Blocks (+2 Effects)
			!line!
			Redstone Blocks (+3 Effects)
			!line!
			Iron Blocks (+4 Effects)
			!line!

			!line!
			Emerald Blocks (+8 Effects)
			!line!
			Moonstone Blocks (+9 Effects)
			!line!
			Sunstone Blocks (+10 Effects)
			!line!
			!line!
			These stack cumulatively, so for example wood planks with glass caps would equal a maximum of 2 effects, whereas stone bricks with redstone caps would have a maximum of 4 effects in a spell.  The maximum number of effects you can currently have on a spell is 13.

		<block id="essenceconduit">
			<name>Essence Conduit</name>
			<desc>Infused with dusts to direct essence through the air, the Essence Conduit began seeing heavy use almost immediately after its invention.  However, channeling such magic often creates a minor void inside the crystal, a defecit of magic.  Should this not be properly managed, the residual essence in the air will violently shatter the vinteum crystal in order to balance the scales once again.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="crystalpillar">
			<name>Crystal Pillar</name>
			<desc>Originally intended to be an improved design of the Essence Conduit, researchers found its ability to channel essence severely lacking.  The materials simply didn't have the conductiveness to relay enough power.  However, the materials were exceptional at preventing magical voids from forming.  A slight re-design allowed these crystals to directly inject residual mana from the area into a magical void from a short distance away, stabilizing it and preventing the vinteum crystals in an Essence Conduit from rupturing.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="blockcaster">
			<name>Caster</name>
			<desc>A spell is nothing more than directed essence.  The will of a magic user dictates what the essence does, and if they have enough capacity for essence, the magic will flow forth.  The caster was designed to replicate that ability, converting raw essence into a burst of magic that is directed through a spell focus (as well as the occasional mana focus) and shaped via the instructions on a spell scroll.  Because of the extreme essence draw of certain spells, the internal crystals were fitted with a slot to allow a charge focus which causes the amount of incoming essence to be increased substantially.  Alternately, a mana focus can be fitted into the same slots, causing the internal essence routing to be much more efficient.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="blockseerstone">
			<name>Seer Stone</name>
			<desc>Operating on a similar principle as the Astral Barrier, the Seer Stone uses an essence aura projected through a spell focus to detect nearby objects.  It can be controlled by focusing the essence to a particular type of object, and the resonant frequency of the essence can be dictated with the use of a Keystone.  Without the use of a Keystone, the resonant frequency fluxuates unpredictably and cannot be avoided.  The seer stone, however, is meant for a more subtle approach, letting the object continue, but emitting a small signal that often activates much more powerful defenses.  By sneaking up and activating the stone, one can even (if he has the correct key of course) cause the stone to invert its detection methods, detecting those with the matching keystone combination.</desc>
		</block>
		<block id="blockastralbarrier">
			<name>Astral Barrier</name>
			<desc>When walking the void, one must be aware of barriers.  Projecting an essence aura through a spell focus, these barriers resonate at a specific magical frequency, dictated by a keytstone.  Without the proper matching keystone, these barriers will destabilize your magics and force you out of the void.  Should the astral barrier not have a keystone present, its magic frequency will fluxuate unpredictably, and no amount of Keystones can protect you from its effects.  Several Dark Magi raids have been foiled and several Light Magi have been captured due to their failure to spot the barrier in time.</desc>

		<block id="blockkeystonerecepticle">
			<name>Keystone Recepticle</name>
			<desc>Not all magi are capable of walking the void as a means of travel, nor are all willing.  The void is detectable, blockable.  Gateways were developed by the Dark Magi early in the war, and it allowed them to take many Light Mage encampments by surprise, as it uses alternate pathways to transport to its destination.  Astral Barriers were ineffective at stopping the arrival of the Dark Magi, and the destination gate required no power of its own.  The Light Magi destroyed as many as they could find, but the Dark Magi only needed one.  The only hope was when a young Light Mage by the name of Damien Callitri discovered that the gateways could be locked down if a Keystone was inserted into a flaw in the design at just the right spot in the gateway mechanism, and would actually cause the gateway to send the Dark Mages to a different gateway (or nowhere if none others existed that weren't locked down).  This halted the raids completely, and allowed the White Magi to turn the tides back in their favour, as they could actually use the gateways to return to their keystone gate.  The design flaw became jokingly known as the "Keystone Recepticle" amongst the White Magi.</desc>

		<block id="ore_vinteum">
			<name>Vinteum Ore</name>
			<desc>Vinteum was discovered during a heated battle between the Light and Dark magi when a stray arcane bolt collided with an ender bolt.  The resulting explosion created a crater several meters deep, where a sparkling blue ore shimmered in the light of the afternoon.  It appears to have no magical properties of its own, but when heat is applied, it becomes a fine dust with an exceptional capacity to conduct essence.  As such, it is widely used in magical contraptions all over the world.</desc>

		<block id="mana_battery">
			<name>Mana Battery</name>
			<desc>Drawing further on vinteum dust's ability to conduct essence, a small group of brilliant magi created a frame out of iron and gold which is capable of storing massive amounts of essence.  The ratios of iron to gold cause any power entering the battery to be polarized, removing it of any dark or light power effects.</desc>

The Blue Orchid emits a faint sparkling glow of light around it as well, and was used just as much for decoration as an alchemical ingredient.  A short while after its discovery, it was also noted that the Blue Orchid could be used as part of the purification process for Vinteum dust.  It is said that anywhere a Blue Orchid can grow, Wisps aren't usually far off.</desc>

Once satisfied with the spell, you can write the spells down in a writable book (you did remember to bring one, didn't you?).  This book can be placed upon a lectern that is part of the Crafting Altar structure, and will guide you through the process needed to make the spell.

When a minecart touches a gold inlay, it will attempt to warp to the next gold inlay in the direction it is currently traveling within 8 blocks.  This can transport the minecart (and any passengers) through solid obstacles, as it is in fact teleportation.  There is a short delay before the minecart can teleport on a gold rail again after it warps.</desc>

		<mechanic id="affinity">
			<name>Affinities</name>
			<desc>Affinity represents a bond to certain areas of magic.  You start with no affinity.  Your affinity is represented as a small chart on the HUD, and can be viewed in more detail at an Occulus (craftable Block).  Your affinity will shift based on what spells you cast, meaning as you cast certain types of spells more often, you will get better at them.
			Casting spells of a differing affinity will shift you towards that affinity.  Once you reach 100% in an affinity, you become locked to that affinity, and will need to cast a significant amount of opposing spells or read an opposing affinity tome to unlock your affinity, at which point normal progression will resume.  Unlocking a full affinity will drop you down to 80% depth.
			
			Each spell component has an affinity.  Components of the same affinity as you will cost less mana, and depending on your affinity depth (how far into the affinity you are), may not even cost reagents.  Components of the opposing affinity, however, will cost more mana and again, depending on your affinity depth, may cost additional reagents.  Affinities offer specific bonuses and disadvantages, described on the affinity-specific pages.			
			</desc>
			<subitem id="earth_affinity">
				<name>Earth Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Earth affinity grants a minor defense bonus, due to your hardened skin.  At max, you will have 10% overall damage reduction, applied before armor.  This amount depends on your affinity depth into earth, and begins at 25% depth.
					!line!
					With earth affinity, you are heavier, and as such you will sink more quickly in water (though never enough that you cannot surface), and you cannot fall as far without taking fall damage.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="water_affinity">
				<name>Water Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Water affinity grants a bonus to swim speed as well as slower breath loss underwater.  You are also not pushed by flowing water.  Endermen that attack a full water-affinity mage will take damage as if they had touched water.
					!line!
					Water affinity mages take damage periodically if exposed to fire, making the nether particularly dangerous.  This damage will not take you below 75% health, and will not occur at all if you are lower.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="air_affinity">
				<name>Air Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Air affinity grants a bonus to jump height and lets you fall farther before taking damage.  These bonuses are dependent on your affinity depth: you can jump one block higher and fall one block farther at 50% depth.  This bonus increases to 2 at 75%, and 3 at full depth.
					!line!
					Air affinity mages are hindered by rain and storms; the wind blows you around and you must move slower.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="fire_affinity">
				<name>Fire Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Fire affinity grants damage reduction in fire and lava, though never complete immunity.  The protection is directly related to your affinity depth, and reaches 60% reduction at full depth.  Punching enemies at full affinity will light them on fire.
					!line!
					Once your fire affinity reaches 50%, you will start to take damage periodically when touching water sources.  This damage will not take you down below 75% health and will not occur if lower.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="nature_affinity">
				<name>Nature Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Nature affinity gives you additional seeds and saplings when harvesting plants from around the world.  At 50% depth, you will gain the Thorns effect, causing melee attackers to take damage (similar to the armor enchant).  This damage increases at 75% affinity and at full affinity.  At full nature affinity you also slowly regenerate hunger in direct sunlight.  At full nature affinity, you can extend roots into the ground, allowing you to climb certain surfaces like a spider does.
					!line!
					Nature affinity causes you to move slightly slower due to your roots. At full nature affinity depth, you lose hunger more quickly at night or in dark areas.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="ice_affinity">
				<name>Ice Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Ice affinity causes attackers to be slowed.  At 50% depth, while sneaking you will freeze water to ice in front of you, allowing you to make bridges as you move.  At 100% depth, you can freeze lava to obsidian.
					!line!
					All ice mages move slightly slower due to being cold blooded, unless on ice or water.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="lightning_affinity">
				<name>Lightning Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Lightning affinity causes you to run faster.  The speed increase is directly related to your affinity depth, ranging from 1 to 30%.  At 50% depth, you gain the ability to step up over one block high ledges.
					!line!
					Unfortunately due to your affinity you are also somewhat of a living lightning rod (50% depth or greater).  Better take cover during rain and thunderstorms.  Lightning bolts still hurt.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="life_affinity">
				<name>Life Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Life affinity causes you to very slowly regenerate additional life.  The regen speed is directly related to your depth.  This regen happens regardless of your hunger level.
					!line!
					Due to your close ties with life, any time you kill something it makes you sick and nauseated for a while.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="arcane_affinity">
				<name>Arcane Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Arcane affinity causes all spells to cost 5% less mana, in addition to other mana reductions.  At full depth, there is also a chance that upon casting a spell, you will gain the clarity effect, causing your next spell to cost 0 mana.
					!line!
					As a disadvantage, all magical damage sources do more damage to you.
				</desc>
			</subitem>
			<subitem id="ender_affinity">
				<name>Ender Affinity</name>
				<desc>
					Ender affinity gives you poison resistance at 50% depth, and at 75% depth you gain night vision automatically in dark areas.  At full ender affinity, Endermen will not attack you, unless you attack them first.
					!line!
					Due to your dark nature, your maximum health is reduced in light, and at full ender affinity, it is reduced in water as well.

			<name>Spell Creation</name>
			<desc>Creating spells is somewhat time consuming, but simple.  First, learn some spell parts using an Occulus.  Next, lay out the spell you want to create at an Inscription Table.  Place the book from the inscription table on the lectern of your crafting altar structure, and throw in a Blank Rune.  The book will guide you through the rest of the process, showing you what you need.  When essence is required during the spell creation process, use a crystal wrench to change the power type if necessary, then flip the switch on the multiblock.  The structure will draw enough power, then turn the switch off automatically.  Once your spell is created, equip it and right click to name it and set the icon.

			<desc>Magic Level represents your strength as a mage.  As your Magic Level increases, so will your Mana and Burnout capacities.  Magic level can be increased by casting valid spells.  A valid spell cast is one that does what is intended, meaning casting fire bolt at a wall for an hour won't get you anywhere.  Certain components that have valid targets more rarely award more magical XP towards the next level.  Your Magic Level is represented by a blue number on your HUD.</desc>

			<name>Foreword</name>
			<desc>Ars Magica began as my first foray into modding.  I have been developing software professionally for about 11 years as of AM2's release, but haven't done much game design.  I loved the game of Minecraft, but felt that it would be the perfect place for a magical world.  So I began, and who would have thought I would enjoy it so much.  I have spent literally hundreds of hours developing AM1 and AM2.  With some good tutorials and a bit of luck, I managed to figure out how to write AM1.  Now I have taken what I learned, solved some of the problems that came up (and probably introduced twice as many more), and have made Ars Magica 2.  I want to thank all of the people who helped this mod come to be what it is today, my beta testers, everyone who helped me with code, models, and texturing - this wouldn't be what it is without you.  And to you, the player, I hope that you have as much fun playing this mod as I did making it. !line! !line! Happy Casting! !line! ~Mithion</desc>

		<guide id="spellComponents101" order="3">
			<name>Spell Components 101</name>
			<desc>Spells are comprised of shapes, components, and modifiers.  Shapes dictate how the spell targets things, Components dictate what the spell does to the things it targets, and Modifiers change certain aspects of spells.  A shape can only appear once in a single spell.  Shapes can be chained together to create spell stages, for example, a "Projectile AoE".  Components can be added once per spell stage. As for modifiers, a single aspect of a spell can be modified three times per stage.  What this means is that if you have modifiers that change multiple parts of a spell, they may lock out other ones that modify the same stats if the total stat modifier for the shape is equal to three.  The compendium will only show you the shapes, components, and modifiers you already know, or are eligible to learn.</desc>

			<name>Your First Spell</name>
			<desc>To make a spell, you will first need to create an Occulus and unlock at least one spell shape and one component.  You start with three blue skill points to make this possible.  Then, craft a writable book and head over to your Inscription Table.  Place the book in the inscription table and drag the spell parts you want, in order, from the top gray section to the bottom gray section.  Once your combination is completed, go to your Crafting Altar and place your book containing the spell recipe on the lectern.  Throw a blank rune into the middle of the crafting altar to begin the process, then follow the book's prompts.  The book itself is worth reading as well, as it contains a recap of what the spell recipe is for, the materials list for the spell and an affinity breakdown of the spell.  Note that certain crafting altars can only craft spells that are so powerful.  Too much power and bad things can happen.  See the entry on the Crafting Altar for more information.</desc>

			<desc>Ars Magica contains a unique power system called Essence.  Essence is generated from a Nexus.  A Nexus will stream to other powered blocks within a 10 block radius.  To extend the range of the nexus, you can place essence conduits within the 10 blocks of the nexus.  Each conduit also projects a radius of 10 blocks  in which it can relay power from the nexus.  Conduits can only transmit so much power before they begin to build up deficit.  The conduit will slowly turn red and begin to smoke, and if the deficit gets too high, the conduit will explode.  Deficit can be mitigated by inserting charge or mana foci into the conduit, or by placing a crystal pillar next to the conduit if that isn't enough.  See conduits for more information.</desc>

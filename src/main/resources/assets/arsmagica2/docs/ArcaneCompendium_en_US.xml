    <shape id="Projectile">
      <name>Projectile</name>
      <desc>You are able to focus your will into a concentrated ball, which you can propel forwards away from you.  The projectile will last for 5 seconds of flight, or until it strikes something.  It will by default pass through water and non-collidable blocks unless you modify it with target non-solid blocks.</desc>

    <shape id="Channel">
      <name>Channeled</name>
      <desc>Through intense concentration, a mage can maintain a flow of magic on themselves.  This is useful for things like Telekinesis, Healing, Attract, and Storm.</desc>
      <modifiedBy></modifiedBy>
    </shape>
    <shape id="Beam">
      <name>Beam</name>
      <desc>It isn't much of a mental shift to switch from a channeled spell to a beam.  The amount of strain, however, is another story.  A beam is a much more controlled version of a channeled spell.</desc>

    </shape>
    <shape id="Self">
      <name>Self</name>
      <desc>One of the simplest forms of magic application is applying the magic to yourself.  The distance is low, and the target is willing.  You only hope you don't accidentally light yourself on fire.</desc>

    </shape>
    <shape id="Touch">
      <name>Touch</name>
      <desc>Simply wrap your hand in magic, and reach out.  Touch is a very short range shape; it does not follow the block highlighting.  You need to be almost bumping into a block for touch to apply its effect.</desc>

    </shape>
    <shape id="AoE">
      <name>AoE</name>
      <desc>After charging your spell, you can shape it into a blast that radiates outwards from the spell's origin.  If gravity is applied, AoE will search downwards for blocks to apply to.  This is useful for lowering a hill without changing its natural shape, and many other things.  An AoE spell will not affect the caster.</desc>
      <modifiedBy>RADIUS,GRAVITY</modifiedBy>
    </shape>
    <shape id="Chain">
      <name>Chain</name>
      <desc>You can shape your magic into a blast that jumps from one target to the next.  Chain by default contains an 8-block built in touch-like component (with an extended range - 8 blocks or so), so there is no need to add additional stages; though you can if you like, projectile for example to start the chain somewhere else.  A chain spell cannot affect the caster.  Chain jump range can be extended by using the #5Range#0 modifier, and the number of jumps can be increased by using #5Procs#0</desc>

    <shape id="Binding">
      <name>Binding</name>
      <desc>You can create solid objects out of nothing!  The binding shape allows you to bind tools to yourself, which drain constant mana while bound, and burst mana when used instead of durability.  Dropping the item with the drop hotkey (default 'q') will instead unbind it.</desc>

    <component id="PhysicalDamage">
      <name>Force Damage</name>
      <desc>Often a young mage will begin his training with simple physical force.  More often he will continue that training by smacking his colleagues in the back of the head with more physical force.  Force is a physical damage type, and does not pierce armor.</desc>

    <component id="MagicDamage">
      <name>Magic Damage</name>
      <desc>Magical damage differs from physical damage in that it bypasses many kinds of armors and attacks the target's aura directly - which can be just as devastating, if not more.  This makes summoned and charmed creatures especially vulnerable, making them take triple damage.</desc>

      <desc>I held my hands in front of me, and with a sharp crack a bolt of brilliant white lightning forked across the sky.  His metal armor acted as a lightning rod, drawing each bolt down into him.  Lightning does an exceptional amount of damage, but carries a hefty mana cost.</desc>

      <desc>The clouds darkened, and rain began to fall.  The wind howled, and a flash of lightning streaked across the sky, leaving bright flashes in my vision.  The thunder was deafening.  Lightning struck all around me at each enemy.  The strain of maintaining the storm was immense. </desc>

Kill enough of the same mob and you will fill the phylactery. !d During spell creation, you can throw in any filled phylactery when prompted by the lectern.  This step is what determines what your spell will summon. !d Summoned creatures drop no loot, and no xp, but can be interacted with normally, such as breeding, milking cows, or riding horses.  Horses are the exception to the item drop rule and will drop saddles and armor given to them. !l Tameable creatures such as wolves and cats are automatically tamed to their owner upon summoning. !d Bosses cannot be trapped in phylacteries in survival/adventure mode. </desc>

      <name>Firestorm</name>
      <desc>You have learned to summon a terrible firestorm, which will do large amounts of damage any entities in its radius.  Firestorm has a built-in AoE to it.  A firestorm cannot be summoned within 5 blocks of another existing firestorm.  It initially does less damage than other attacks, but scales more quickly with modifiers.  It also has the unique capability to deal damage more often than regular attacks.  Firestorm does not ignite the ground.  Though firestorm will harm all entities in its radius, it will never harm its caster.</desc>

    <component id="ManaLink">
      <name>Mana Link</name>
      <desc>You have discovered the secret to linking your mana together with another entity.  When you cast this spell, your target will be able to draw upon your mana pool as if it were their own. !d The target will use their own mana first, then will begin to draw upon yours. !d It has a limited radius, but can have radius modifiers if you so desire.  If the target leaves the radius, the link is not broken, but is rather temporarily disabled.  When they again return into the radius, the link will reactivate and will function again.  To end the link, simply cast the spell on the target again. !d You can link your own mana to multiple entities, and on the other side, you can have multiple links coming in from other sources.</desc>

    <component id="PlaceBlock">
      <name>Place Block</name>
      <desc>You can use this spell part to place blocks!  Can be extremely powerful when combined with different shape combinations.  In order to place a block, you need to set the spell to place it, and you need to have at least one of said block in your inventory.  No creating them out of thin air, sorry!  To set the block to be placed, cast the spell on a block while sneaking.  You need to be sneaking when the spell actually applies, so keep that in mind when using something like Projectile.  It's recommended to not use AoE to set the block, as it can sometimes set it to something you don't expect (as it will apply to everything in a radius, setting the block over and over).  To see what block the spell will place, hover your mouse over it in your inventory and press SHIFT.</desc>

      <desc>A more advanced version of simple robes, mage armor allows for slightly more durability, recharge, and protection.  Mage armor, due to the runes inlaid in it, has very high capability to be enchanted.  It also can repair its condition using mana drawn from its wearer.  When wearing a full suit of mage armor, your mana regen speed is increased and all spells are slightly more effective.</desc>

      <desc>Granted only to mages who have proven themselves true masters, Battlemage Armor offers a good amount of protection.  It has higher durability than Mage Armor, but has a slower repair rate and less enchantability, as well as giving lesser versions of the magical bonuses that mage armor does.  Battlemage Armor can also be given XP which will unlock protective spells that will come to the aid of its wearer, draining some of the magic within the armor.  The magic will then infuse back over time from your own mana pool.</desc>

      <desc>
	  The crystal wrench serves many purposes.  It can be used to direct Etherium through your power network.  
	  To do this, #9right click first on the source of Etherium you want to use#0.  This marks the source block. Then, #9right click on the destination while still holding the wrench#0.  
	  #5Note that there is no need to click on Etherium Conduits along the way - just click on the final block.  The power system will attempt to pathfind through nearby Etherium Conduits automatically#0.  
	  If that fails for any reason, you will be notified.  This will force a pairing, and ensures the Etherium goes where you want it to.  
	  !d 
	  If you #9sneak while right clicking on the source#0, the wrench's crystal will turn green.  This means the crystal wrench is remembering the source block's location, and you can click on several destinations 
	  in a row without having to return to the source.  Each destination right clicked on in this state will be paired (if possible) to the remembered source.  
	  !d
	  You can also disconnect power nodes by #9Sneaking and right clicking#0 on a #5non-powered block#0.  This will switch the wrench's mode from link to unlink.  You can see the change when the crystal on the wrench 
	  turns red.  To switch it back, simply repeat the sneak right click to change the crystal back to purple.  If you have a stored location, it will need to be cleared first before the mode can be switched (which is 
	  also done by sneak right-clicking a non-powered block).
	  !p 
	  The crystal wrench can also be used to show hidden particle emitters, and can copy their settings by right clicking when in unlink mode.  The settings can then be pasted to another emitter by right clicking.  
	  Each time you "paste" settings, you will need to copy them again if you wish to paste to additional emitters.</desc>

      <desc>Gateways are quite efficient at short range, but longer distances require significantly more Etherium.  The maximum range for a Gateway has been tested to be roughly 12km, though an extreme amount of Etherium is required to traverse such a span.  A keystone can be inserted into the Keystone Receptacle in order to lock the gateway to the keystone's rune combination.  Only then by activating another gateway with a matching keystone can one arrive at the keyed gateway.  If the key does not match or no keystone is held at all when the gate is activated, it will be as if the keyed gateway doesn't even exist.  This method can be used to control where you will wind up in the gateway network.</desc>

			Harnessing the forces of creation, the crafting altar allows mages to work miracles of magic.  This is where you will create all of your spells in Ars Magica.  The structure is upgradeable by 2 main groups, the caps and the main material.  Both groups individually increase the available power of the altar and allow it to make more powerful spells.  The main blocks, in order of power, are as follows:
			!l
			Wood Planks (+1 Effect)
			!l
			Stone Brick (+1 Effect)
			!l
			Sandstone (+1 Effect)
			!l
			Bricks (+2 Effects)
			!l
			Witchwood (+2 Effects)
			!l
			Nether Bricks (+3 Effects)
			!l
			Nether Quartz (+3 Effects)
			!l
			!l
			For the caps (grand total of 5 in the structure), the progression is as follows:
			!l
			Glass (+1 Effect)
			!l
			Coal Blocks (+2 Effects)
			!l
			Redstone Blocks (+3 Effects)
			!l

			These stack cumulatively, so for example wood planks with glass caps would equal a maximum of 2 effects, whereas stone bricks with redstone caps would have a maximum of 4 effects in a spell.  The maximum number of effects you can currently have on a spell is 13.

For example, when throwing down runes to recall to a gateway using a ritual, the order of the runes will become the keystone combination. !d  The spell must target the exact center block of the ritual, on the same y-level as the chalk and candles.

				resistant to physical damage. If all the mana is drained

	  !d
			Flickers are timid by nature and will flick back to their own dimension if attacked, or if they feel threatened.  Giving them a modicum of magic in the form of #5some sort of lasting effect#0 makes them feel more comfortable and less likely to run away.  #5Flickers can be captured inside of a Flicker Jar#0.
			!d
			There is one type of flicker for each affinity.  Flickers of each affinity will behave differently.  For example, Air Flickers tend to like to stay higher above the ground, while Earth Flickers will prefer to stay low.

Create a 5x5 ring using wizard's chalk, and place a warding candle in the center part of each side, on the outside of the ring (4 candles in total).

      <desc>Tales are told in hushed whispers of the true guardian of the End.  Of eyes glowing with an abhorrent light, and scaly skin as black as a moonless night.  Alas, the tales of this waking nightmare are vague at best and always shrouded in the veil of speculation.  The truth is, nobody has ever seen the guardian and lived.  The most common tale is that of Magnus Severinus, the Archmage of the Second Era.  At the height of his power, he was rumored to be able to move mountains with a thought, create lush gardens out of the most barren terrain, and create wards that could stop an army cold.  Alas, his most trusted advisor took ill, and her spiteful stepson had taken her place.  Goaded by honeyed words encouraging his power and making him arrogant, he gathered the conclave together and in front of them all, tore open the fabric between worlds, opening a portal to the end that pulsed with a soft purple glow that almost seemed to draw light away from its surroundings.  He stepped in, and summoned the guardian.  He never had time to scream.  A piece of paper, flecked with bits of dark blood, flitted back through the portal and it winked shut.  Upon the paper was the following ritual: !d In the End, around a black aurem atop a platform of blackest coal, create an inlay of gold.  Light a burning fire on each side of the inlay.  Throw in an Ender Essence and an Eye of Ender to destabilize the aurem and summon the guardian. !d The paper was locked away in magical valuts and forgotten for millenia...until now.</desc>

      <name>Essence Refiner</name>
      <desc>
				The essence refiner takes everyday items and using
				#5Arcane Ash#0, refines them into a pure representation
				of their parts, known as #5essences#0. The recipes for
				specific essences can be found under #9Items -&gt;
				Essences#0. The essence refiner also requires #2Etherium#0 to function.
				Neutral Etherium can be obtained from an #9Obelisk#0, which has no specific advantages or
				drawbacks. Finally, Dark Etherium can be used from a
				#9Black Aurem#0, which significantly reduces the amount
				of time it takes to refine the essence. The spinning ring
				on the UI will shift from blue to purple as the
				refinement process progresses and eventually completes.
				A flashing red ring means there is insufficient Etherium to
				continue, and the process has been paused.

				Infused with dusts to direct Etherium through the

				range of 10 blocks, and can form chains to move Etherium 
				up to 100 blocks away from the origin.

      <desc>
				A spell is nothing more than directed essence. The will
				of a magic user dictates what the essence does, and if
				they have enough capacity for essence, the magic will
				flow forth. The caster was designed to replicate that
				ability, converting raw essence into a burst of magic
				that is directed through a spell focus (as well as the
				occasional mana focus) and shaped via the instructions
				on a spell scroll. Because of the extreme essence draw
				of certain spells, the internal crystals were fitted
				with a slot to allow a charge focus which causes the
				amount of incoming essence to be increased
				substantially. Alternately, a mana focus can be fitted
				into the same slots, causing the internal essence
				routing to be much more efficient.

      <name>Seer Stone</name>
      <desc>
				Operating on a similar principle as the Astral Barrier,
				the Seer Stone uses an Etherium aura projected through a
				spell focus to detect nearby objects. It can be
				controlled by focusing the Etherium to a particular type
				of object, and the resonant frequency of the Etherium can
				be dictated with the use of a rune combination. Without the use
				of a rune combination, the resonant frequency fluxuates
				unpredictably and cannot be avoided. The seer stone,
				however, is meant for a more subtle approach, letting
				the object continue, but emitting a small signal that
				often activates much more powerful defenses. By sneaking
				up and activating the stone, one can even (if he has the
				correct key of course) cause the stone to invert its
				detection methods, detecting those with the matching
				keystone combination.
				!d
				Different #5Foci#0 can be used in the Seer Stone.  #5Lesser, 
				Standard, and Greater foci#0 change the detection distance of 
				the stone (5, 10, or 15 blocks respectively), while #5Item, 
				Player, Monster, or Creature foci#0 can
				change what the seer stone is looking for.  Without a target
				focus and a distance focus, the seer stone will not function.
				!d
				A keystone is 
				searched for in the case of a player.  If the player has a
				keystone in their inventory matching the rune combination in
				the seer stone, the seer stone will ignore them and will not
				trigger.

      <name>Astral Barrier</name>
      <desc>
				When walking the void, one must be aware of barriers.
				Projecting an Etherium aura through a spell focus, these
				barriers resonate at a specific magical frequency,
				dictated by a keytstone. Without the proper matching
				keystone, these barriers will destabilize your magics
				and force you out of the void. Should the astral barrier
				not have a keystone present, its magic frequency will
				fluxuate unpredictably, and no amount of Keystones can
				protect you from its effects. Several Dark Magi raids
				have been foiled and several Light Magi have been
				captured due to their failure to spot the barrier in
				time.
				!d
				Different #5Foci#0 can be used in the Astral Barrier.  #5Lesser, 
				Standard, and Greater foci#0 change the distance of 
				the barrier, to 5, 10, or 15 blocks respectively. Without
				a distance focus, the barrier will not function.
				!d
				The barrier will stop teleportation into its radius, including
				ender pearls, blink, mark/recall, and endermen.

      <name>Keystone Recepticle</name>
      <desc>
				Not all magi are capable of walking the void as a means
				of travel, nor are all willing. The void is detectable,
				blockable. Gateways were developed by the Dark Magi
				early in the war, and it allowed them to take many Light
				Mage encampments by surprise, as it uses alternate
				pathways to transport to its destination. Astral
				Barriers were ineffective at stopping the arrival of the
				Dark Magi, and the destination gate required no power of
				its own. The Light Magi destroyed as many as they could
				find, but the Dark Magi only needed one. The only hope
				was when a young Light Mage by the name of Damien
				Callitri discovered that the gateways could be locked
				down if a Keystone was inserted into a flaw in the
				design at just the right spot in the gateway mechanism,
				and would actually cause the gateway to send the Dark
				Mages to a different gateway (or nowhere if none others
				existed that weren't locked down). This halted the raids
				completely, and allowed the White Magi to turn the tides
				back in their favour, as they could actually use the
				gateways to return to their keystone gate. The design
				flaw became jokingly known as the "Keystone Recepticle"
				amongst the White Magi.

				Vinteum was discovered during a heated battle between

				created a crater several meters deep, where a sparkling
				blue ore shimmered in the light of the afternoon. It
				appears to have no magical properties of its own, but
				when heat is applied, it becomes a fine dust with an
				exceptional capacity to conduct Etherium. As such, it is
				widely used in magical contraptions all over the world.

				Drawing further on vinteum dust's ability to conduct

				massive amounts of Etherium. Mana batteries will
				always provide power to connected devices, but they can
				also request Etherium from the network
				when given a redstone signal.
				
				Unfortunately, the process used to manufacture the battery
				makes it somewhat volatile, causing it to lose all stored
				Etherium if it is moved without the careful touch of a
				mage's hand.

Once satisfied with the spell, you can write the spells down in a writable book (you did remember to bring one, didn't you?).  This book can be placed upon a lectern that is part of the Crafting Altar structure, and will guide you through the process needed to make the spell.

      <name>Armor Imbuement Table</name>
      <desc>The Armor Imbuement Table can be used to attach special imbuements to any armor in Minecraft.  In order to do this, you first need to have the armor equipped.  Mousing over any armor will display a prompt of "Press SHIFT for more information".  Doing so will show you how much XP has been absorbed into the armor.  Armor gains XP when you do.  See #5Mechanics -&gt; Armor XP Infusion#0 for more information on how it works. !d Once your armor has reached at least level 30, you can apply a Tier I imbuement to it.  Simply equip the armor and activate the Armor Imbuement Table.  Place the armor from the equip slots at the bottom of the UI into the active slot.  Available imbuements will appear in colour, unavailable ones will be grayscale.  You can only apply one tier of imbuement per armor piece, so choose wisely!  !d The tier costs are: !l Tier 1: 30 levels !l Tier 2: 42 levels !l Tier 3: 54 levls !l Tier 4: 66 levels !d Each time you imbue the armor, XP is deducted from it to apply the imbuement.</desc>

      <name>Affinities</name>
      <desc>#5Affinity#0 represents a bond to certain areas of magic.  You start with no affinity.  Your affinity is represented as a small chart on the HUD, and can be viewed in more detail at an Occulus (craftable Block).  Your affinity will shift based on what spells you cast, meaning as you cast certain types of spells more often, you will get better at them.
			Casting spells of a differing affinity will shift you towards that affinity.  Once you reach 100% in an affinity, you become locked to that affinity, and will need to read an opposing affinity tome to unlock your affinity, at which point normal progression will resume.  Unlocking a full affinity will drop you down to 80% depth.
			
			Each spell component has an affinity.  Components of the same affinity as you will cost less mana, and depending on your affinity depth (how far into the affinity you are), may not even cost reagents.  Components of the opposing affinity, however, will cost more mana and again, depending on your affinity depth, may cost additional reagents.  Affinities offer specific bonuses and disadvantages, described on the affinity-specific pages.

					!d

					!d
					Air affinity mages are hindered by rain and storms; the wind blows you around and you must move slower.  #5Sneaking#0 or casting a spell of #5Gravity Well#0 can negate the effect and allow you to move in the storm, albeit slowly.

At full nature affinity you also slowly regenerate hunger in direct sunlight.  At full nature affinity, you can extend roots into the ground, allowing you to climb certain surfaces like a spider does.
					!d
					Nature affinity causes you to move slightly slower due to your roots. At full nature affinity depth, you lose hunger more quickly at night or in dark areas.
					!d
					At full nature affinity, you gain the aspect of a leaf on the wind, negating all fall damage and falling more slowly.  You can sneak to fall at normal speed.  This will still cause fall damage to be negated.

      <desc>Creating spells is somewhat time consuming, but simple.  First, learn some spell parts using an #5Occulus#0.  Next, lay out the spell you want to create at an #5Inscription Table#0.  Place the book from the inscription table on the lectern of your crafting altar structure, and throw in a #5Blank Rune#0.

When Etherium is required during the spell creation process, use a #5crystal wrench#0 to change the power type if necessary, then flip the switch on the multiblock.

Due to this mechanic, all AM armor has low durability, and won't last in a prolonged fight.  Taking the armor off will cause it to stop infusing - it must be equipped for the mechanic to function.  If the armor is at full durability, there is no mana cost.</desc>

      <desc>Mana is your magical energy level.  You gain more mana by increasing your Magic Level. !d Mana regenerates over time, but you can gain boosts to regeneration by eating a #9Mana Cake#0 or standing near an Obelisk, Celestial Prism, or Black Aurem with more than 10% charge.  #9Mana Potions#0 and #9Mana Potion Bundles#0 can be used to give an instant boost to mana.  Mana is represented by a blue bar on your HUD.  You can use "#2/amuicfg#0" to toggle an option to show the actual numeric values of your mana.</desc>

      <name>Magic Level</name>
      <desc>Magic Level represents your strength as a mage.  As your Magic Level increases, so will your Mana and Burnout capacities.  Magic level can be increased by casting valid spells.  A valid spell cast is one that does what is intended, meaning casting fire bolt at a wall for an hour won't get you anywhere.  Certain components that have valid targets more rarely award more magical XP towards the next level.  Your Magic Level is represented by a blue number on your HUD.  You can use "#2/amuicfg#0" to toggle an option to show the actual numeric values of your magic XP bar.</desc>

      <desc>Burnout is your level of strain when casting spells.  The higher your Burnout, the more mana each spell will cost.  Casting more powerful spells will cause more Burnout.  It will decrease over time.  Gaining Magic Levels will give you a higher Burnout cap, allowing you to cast more spells before becoming completely fatigued.  Your Burnout level is displayed as a red bar on the HUD.  You can use "#2/amuicfg#0" to toggle an option to show the actual numeric values of your burnout.</desc>

      <desc>On occasion, during the night, small meteors may crash down into the overworld.  This is the only way to obtain moonstone ore.  A full moon increases the odds of one spawning.  The meteor always falls within 32 blocks of a player, and they will only ever fall on a biome's cover block.  Meaning unless you have a house made of grass, it won't even hit your home.  If you do have a house made of grass, then what is wrong with you?  Didn't you ever read the three little pigs?</desc>

      <desc>Silver skills are skills inside the occulus that cannot be obtained in normal ways.  To unlock a silver skill, the correct spell combination must be crafted, and then cast.  There are a few rules to silver skill unlock combinations that will make them somewhat easier to decipher. !d 1.) All parts required to unlock a silver skill will be in the #9same tree as the silver skill itself#0. !d 2.) All silver skills require between #9 2 and 4 components and/or modifiers to unlock#0. !d 3.) Shapes do not matter in unlocking a silver skill.  #9Any shape can be used#0. !d 4.) The combination #9does not have to be in any specific order#0.  As long as the correct components are present, it will work. !d 5.) The components/modifiers #9all have to be in the same stage#0. !d 6.) The components and modifiers #9will logcally make sense with the silver skill#0.  For example, Firestorm won't require drown. !d 7.) The spell to unlocka silver skill may not be the most practical for common use.</desc>

      <name>Foreword</name>
      <desc>Ars Magica began as my first foray into modding.  I have been developing software professionally for about 11 years as of AM2's release, but haven't done much game design.  I loved the game of Minecraft, but felt that it would be the perfect place for a magical world.  So I began, and who would have thought I would enjoy it so much.  I have spent literally hundreds of hours developing AM1 and AM2.  With some good tutorials and a bit of luck, I managed to figure out how to write AM1.  Now I have taken what I learned, solved some of the problems that came up (and probably introduced twice as many more), and have made Ars Magica 2.  I want to thank all of the people who helped this mod come to be what it is today, my beta testers, everyone who helped me with code, models, and texturing - this wouldn't be what it is without you.  And to you, the player, I hope that you have as much fun playing this mod as I did making it. !d Happy Casting! !l ~Mithion</desc>

      <name>Using this Compendium</name>
      <desc>This compendium is set up to unlock entries as you get to them, to somewhat guide you through the getting started process of the mod.  You will be notified when you unlock a new entry.  Categories with new items in them will shimmer, and new entries themselves will have a crescent moon marking them as new.  !d If you prefer to not have this, you can disable it in config by changing "Staged Compendium" to false.  This compendium is #9intra-linking#0.  Any item you hover over that has green text can be clicked and you will jump to the entry for that item. !d This compendium also leaves a breadcrumb trail, meaning you can step back through in reverse order through pages you have visited.</desc>

      <name>The Ars Magica UI</name>
      <desc>The act of picking up a compendium has unlocked the arcane magics within you.  You now have the AM2 HUD activated.  To configure this UI, at any time, enter the command "#2/amuicfg#0".  This will open a drag and drop configuration interface.  Make your changes and press ESC to save them.</desc>

    <guide id="spellComponents101" order="5">
      <name>Spell Components 101</name>
      <desc>Spells are comprised of #4shapes#0, #9components#0, and #2modifiers#0.  Shapes dictate how the spell targets things, Components dictate what the spell does to the things it targets, and Modifiers change certain aspects of spells.  A #4shape#0 can only appear once in a single spell.  Shapes can be chained together to create spell stages, for example, a "Projectile AoE".  Components can be added once per spell stage. As for modifiers, a single aspect of a spell can be modified three times per stage.  What this means is that if you have modifiers that change multiple parts of a spell, they may lock out other ones that modify the same stats if the total stat modifier for the shape is equal to three.  The compendium will only show you the shapes, components, and modifiers you already know, or are eligible to learn.</desc>

    <guide id="yourFirstSpell" order="3" unlocked="true">
      <name>Your First Spell</name>
      <desc>To make a spell, you will first need to create an #5Occulus#0 and unlock at least one spell shape and one component.  You start with three blue skill points to make this possible.  Then, craft a writable book and head over to your #5Inscription Table#0.  Place the book in the inscription table. !d There are three sections of the Inscription Table UI that are of note.  The source region is the large grey square at the top, and will contain all of your known shapes, components, and modifiers.  The Shape Group section is identified by brown squares.  There are multiple brown squares as multiple shape groups can be created.  Finally there is the Spell Grammar section, which is the gray rectangle at the bottom.  !d Create #5Shape Groups#0 by dragging shapes and/or modifiers from the source region to any of the shape groups in the UI.  You can create multiple shape groups in the same spell, three by default.  Each shape group can have up to four shapes/modifiers.  Shape groups cannot contain components. A good way to think about it is that shape groups are different means of targeting things with the spell, then the spell grammar is what the spell actually does. !d Once your shape groups are created, drag the spell parts you want, in order, from the source region to the spell grammar section. The spell grammar section can contain spell shapes, components, and modifiers in addition to the shape groups.  Once your combination is completed, go to your #5Crafting Altar#0 and place your book containing the spell recipe on the lectern.  Throw a #5blank rune#0 into the middle of the crafting altar to begin the process, then follow the book's prompts.  The book itself is worth reading as well, as it contains a recap of what the spell recipe is for, the materials list for the spell and an affinity breakdown of the spell.  Note that certain crafting altars can only craft spells that are so powerful.  Too much power and bad things can happen.  See the entry on the #5Crafting Altar#0 for more information.</desc>

      <name>A Few Recommended Spells</name>
      <desc>When starting out, it's recommended to make sure you take at least one #9Shape#0 and one #9Component#0 in the Occulus, lest you find yourself unable to make any spells.  If you do this, you can either go looking in dungeons for #9Infinity Orbs#0, or try to fight a boss or two to get some more.  If you're feeling cheaty, you can also use the /respec command. !p Here are a few sample spells to get you started: !d Basic Defense: !l Projectile + Physical Damage !d Stay Alive: !l Self + Regeneration !d Time to Mine: !l Touch/Projectile + Dig !d Clear Leaves: !l Projectile + Wizard's Autumn !d Fast Travel: !l Self/Projectile + Leap + Slowfall + Haste + Gravity Well</desc>

      <desc>You gain magic levels by casting spells.  You don't gain magic XP if the cast isn't successful, and there are diminishing returns on a cooldown, so spamming spells to grind won't get you anywhere.  Casting spells also modifies your affinity.  See #5Mechanics -&gt; Affinity#0 for more information.</desc>

      <name>Obtaining Skill Points</name>
      <desc>You get skill points primarily by leveling up.  At each even level, you will gain one skill point.  Levels 2-20 award blue skill points, 22-40 award green skill points, and 42-50 award red skill points.  Additional points can be obtained by fighting bosses, trading with villagers, and exploring.  You choose how you want to go about it!  When viewing unlockables in the #5Occulus#0, hovering over the item will display #9text that matches the skill point color needed to unlock it#0.</desc>

      <name>The Etherium System</name>
      <desc>Ars Magica contains a unique power system called #5Etherium#0.  Etherium is generated from an #5Obelisk#0.  An Obelisk will stream to other powered blocks within a 10 block radius.  To extend the range of the Obelisk, you can place #5Etherium Conduits#0 within the 10 blocks of the obelisk.  Each conduit also projects a radius of 10 blocks in which it can relay power from the obelisk, essentially extending the range in a chain. !d There are multiple types of Etherium.  Different types of Etherium can be generated by other blocks, suck as #9Light Etherium#0 from a #5Celestial Prism#0 or #4Dark Etherium#0 from a #5Black Aurem#0.  All Etherium types have the same transmit rules as the Obelisk, and can be extended by Etherium Conduits.</desc>
    </guide>
    <guide id="powerTypes" order="9">
      <name>Types of Etherium</name>
      <desc>There are three types of Etherium, by default.  Addons to the mod can register new Etherium types, but the defaults are Light, Neutral, and Dark.  See structures for crafting and variations of each of these.  Each type of Etherium affects machines in a different way, and has advantages and disadvantages.  You will also need all three types of Etherium available for spell crafting, as certain shapes, components, and modifiers can require different types of Etherium.  Certain machines can only run on certain types of Etherium, and some machines require multiple types simultaneously.</desc>
